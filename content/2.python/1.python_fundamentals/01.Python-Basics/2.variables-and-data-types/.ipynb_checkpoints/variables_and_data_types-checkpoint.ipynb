    "# Variables and data types\n",
    "Variables are used to temporarily store a value in the computer's memory. We can then use it later, when we need it in the program. We can compare that to a small box in which we could store information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python is a dynamically typed language, Python values, not variables, carry type. This has implications for many aspects of the way the language functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "All variables in Python hold references to objects, and these references are passed to functions; a function cannot change the value of variable references in its calling function (but see below for exceptions). Some people (including Guido van Rossum himself) have called this parameter-passing scheme \"Call by object reference.\" An object reference means a name, and the passed reference is an \"alias\", i.e. a copy of the reference to the same object, just as in C/C++. The object's value may be changed in the called function with the \"alias\", for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naming and code writing conventions\n",
    "As in many programming languages, to name a variable, some conventions must be respected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. The name of the variable must start with a **letter or an underscore**. The variable can not start with a number or a hyphen.         \n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Bad example :\n",
    "```py\n",
    "# Do not do this\n",
    "2Name = \"James\" \n",
    "\n",
    "# Do not do this\n",
    "-name = \"James\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Good example :\n",
    "```py\n",
    "# Do this\n",
    "name = \"James\" \n",
    "\n",
    "# Do this\n",
    "_name = \"James\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### 2. **Never put space between words.** \n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Bad example :\n",
    "```py\n",
    "# Do not do this\n",
    "My name = \"Odile\" \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Good example :\n",
    "```py\n",
    "# DO is\n",
    "my_name = \"Odile\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. No accents on the names of variables. **Use only English**\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Bad example :\n",
    "```py\n",
    "# Do not do this\n",
    "prénom = \"Odile\" \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Good example :\n",
    "```py\n",
    "# Do this\n",
    "first_name = \"Odile\" \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Always give an explicit name** to the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Bad example :\n",
    "```py\n",
    "# Do not do this\n",
    "a = \"Odile\" \n",
    "\n",
    "# Do not do this\n",
